[![Login to WordPress admin dashboard](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pqq1tab5m1ex9ds/01-WordPress-admin-login.png?raw=1)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pqq1tab5m1ex9ds/01-WordPress-admin-login.png?raw=1)

*Tip: You must have WordPress admin access in order to install and remove plugins.*

#### 🔌 Navigate to Plugins, Add New

[![Navigate to Plugins, Add New](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5w4592w4vfz4o2i/02-plugins-add-new.png?raw=1)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5w4592w4vfz4o2i/02-plugins-add-new.png?raw=1)

*Tip: Depending on your site setup, you may need to search a bit to find navigation items. Some themes and plugins alter the appearance of your WordPress admin dashboard.*

#### 🗄 Upload plugin via zip file
Click Upload Plugin just to the right of Add Plugins

[![Upload plugin via zip file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mya8j56qsf8x341/03-manual-upload-plugin.png?raw=1)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mya8j56qsf8x341/03-manual-upload-plugin.png?raw=1)

*Tip: This is usually in your Downloads folder unless you've changed your browser settings.*

#### 🔛 Activate plugin
Click Activate Plugin. Essentially this turns the plugin code functionality "on."

[![Activate plugin](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7raxgoklit732vt/05-manual-activate-plugin.png?raw=1)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7raxgoklit732vt/05-manual-activate-plugin.png?raw=1)

*Tip: You can deactivate plugins to troubleshoot website issues. Slowly deactivate them one-by-one, each time checking to see if the error persists. If you find one plugin is the problem, visit their changelog or website for latest news or updates. Also ensure all of your plugins are always up-to-date.*

#### ⚙️ Configure Fast plugin settings
Now that you activated the plugin, you can click the Fast plugin link now shown in the left side admin navigation (towards the bottom usually), to navigate to the plugin settings window.

Direct url to your plugin settings is `http://yourwebsite.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=fast`

##### 🆔 Add your App ID
Copy your App ID from your seller dashboard and enter it into the App ID field in the Fast plugin settings. Scroll down and click Save Changes at the bottom.

[![Configure Fast plugin settings](https://www.dropbox.com/s/geqt419gp26ymrn/06-manual-configure-plugin.png?raw=1)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/geqt419gp26ymrn/06-manual-configure-plugin.png?raw=1)

*Tip: You can copy & paste your App ID from the seller dashboard to your WordPress website so you don't have to re-type it all. Use your mouse to highlight the text. Navigate to edit in your menu bar, then click Copy. Navigate back to your WordPress admin dashboard and click into the App ID field. Go to edit again, but this time, click Paste.*

##### 🧪 Test functionality and review appearance of Fast buttons
Test the following pages and functions of your website to ensure Fast is integrated properly, as well as appears the way you would like it to appear.

* Cart page `https://yourwebsite.com/cart`
* Checkout page `https://yourwebsite.com/checkout`
* Mini cart `varies depending on theme`
* Login page `https://yourwebsite.com/my-account`
